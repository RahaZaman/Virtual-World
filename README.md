## üîç Technical Implementation

### Rendering Architecture

The rendering system follows a pipeline approach:

1. **Scene Graph Management**:
   - Hierarchical structure for world objects
   - Efficient matrix composition and inheritance
   - Optimized culling of off-screen geometry

2. **Shader Programs**:
   ```glsl
   // Vertex shader handles camera transformations
   gl_Position = u_ProjectionMatrix * u_ViewMatrix * 
                 u_GlobalRotateMatrix * u_ModelMatrix * a_Position;
   ```
   - Position transformations with model, view, and projection matrices
   - Texture coordinate mapping with varying variables
   - Multiple texture support with uniform samplers

3. **World Representation**:
   - 32√ó32 procedurally generated grid
   - Height-map based terrain with varying elevation
   - Multi-textured blocks with position-based variation

### Camera System

The camera implementation showcases advanced 3D mathematics:

```javascript
// Forward vector calculation
let forward = new Vector3([
  this.at.elements[0] - this.eye.elements[0],
  0,  // Keep y-axis movement flat for natural navigation
  this.at.elements[2] - this.eye.elements[2]
]);

// Normalization and movement
forward.normalize();
let scaledX = forward.elements[0] * speed;
let scaledZ = forward.elements[2] * speed;
```

Key components:
- **View Matrix**: Calculated from eye, at, and up vectors
- **Projection Matrix**: Perspective projection with configurable FOV
- **Input Handling**: WASD movement with QE rotation and mouse look
- **Physics**: Speed-adjusted movement with boundary detection

### Texture Management

The texture system demonstrates efficient resource handling:

```javascript
// Initialize and configure texture
gl.activeTexture(gl.TEXTURE0);
gl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, texture);
gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, gl.LINEAR);
gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, gl.LINEAR);
gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_WRAP_S, gl.REPEAT);
gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_WRAP_T, gl.REPEAT);
```

Features include:
- **Asynchronous Loading**: Non-blocking texture loading with callbacks
- **Multiple Texture Units**: Support for multiple textures in a single render pass
- **UV Mapping**: Precise texture coordinate mapping with repeating patterns
- **Texture Selection**: Runtime switching between different textures

### World Generation

The world generation algorithm creates varied and interesting environments:

```javascript
// Procedural generation sample
for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < 32; j++) {
    // Border walls with height variation
    if (i === 0 || i === 31 || j === 0 || j === 31) {
      g_map[i][j] = 3 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 2); 
    } 
    // Interior architectural structures
    else if (i === 10 && j >= 10 && j <= 20) {
      g_map[i][j] = 5; // Tall building
    }
    /* Additional generation rules */
  }
}
```

The algorithm implements:
- **Parametric Structures**: Buildings, walls, and terrain features
- **Randomized Elements**: Height variation and texture selection
- **Landform Creation**: Hills, mountains, and special structures like pyramids
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient generation without blocking the main thread

## üéÆ User Interaction

### Camera Controls
- **W/S**: Forward/backward movement along view direction
- **A/D**: Strafe left/right perpendicular to view
- **Q/E**: Rotate camera left/right around vertical axis
